    <h1>Susan Sontag Reading Response</h1>
    <p>I didn’t think I was going to enjoy this reading, I was wrong. I found quite a few of the points and ideas that Sontag lays out resonated with me or I agreed with. One of the first and biggest points that Sontag makes is that photography is unlike almost any other media, because as Sontag puts it, “To photograph is to appropriate the thing photographed.” Or as I think of it sometimes, theft from the world. That when I go out and shoot I’m not creating something, I’m just taking it from the world that has created it. This idea of taking possession of a photo is even more important for Sontag who at the time was dealing with only physical media, pictures needed to be printed to be viewed in any way. Which brings me to another connection I see is that photography in many ways isn’t special anymore. Where Sontag talks about the desensitization of gruesome scenes during war and the novelty of photography, today we are even more desensitized to almost everything. The unlimited access to the knowledge of the world means that nothing is truly special or new anymore, that there is a good chance everything you do has been seen or done before.

        I started with photography when I took an afterschool program at my high school, learning the fundamentals of composition and lighting. I can’t remember most of it anymore, but what I do remember was the feel of the camera in my hands, the feeling of that power that Sontag talks about, and the pressure of capturing the moment and getting it right. That pressure is what makes photography feel right to me, it’s what reminds me that photography isn’t theft. It can be creative, you can see one little thing on the street, a construction lamp lighting up the scaffolding, and a specific shot will come to mind, a vision that you can create.

        One of the other topics that I connected with most was the link between tourism and photography, and the use of photography to capture moments you want to remember. When I go somewhere, another country, or even a museum I generally don’t take photos because then the experience you are enjoying becomes a checklist. It’s no longer about seeing these places and taking in the majesty, it’s about getting the photo and leaving. I understand it, and there are times where I wish I took a photo of a moment or a place, but in many ways it takes you out of the experience. As Sontag puts it, “the camera between themselves and whatever is remarkable,” instead of experiencing whatever it is, you make yourself an observer, you remove yourself from the thing you are capturing. That’s not to say that taking photos of beautiful things is a bad idea, but you shouldn’t let yourself be distracted from what is right in front of you by taking a photo.
