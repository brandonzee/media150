        <h2>Creative Statement</h2> 
        <p>I aim to create something that looks good and can tell a story. Stories are something that I have loved since childhood from books, to movies, to video games. There is something magical about a story that can pull you into it, and that is the feeling I want to capture. The majority of my previous work has been in photography striving to capture the beautiful parts of the world, from lights on the ceiling to sweeping landscapes.  I primarily follow my gut instinct of what looks good, and enjoy experimenting trying to find what feels right. In the past I have taken a course in photography and taught myself to use the basics of photoshop. I am looking forward to learning more about intentional creation.
