        <h1>AI Slop Reading Response</h1>
        <p>
            Whenever I talk with my friends about AI it always comes back to the idea that AI sucks, and while I do not totally agree with them I can not totally disagree with them. For me I find the idea of AI and the possibilities of what it can do for us quite promising. However, in practice most AI features and ideas that have come out so far have been clunky, bad, or downright harmful. What this article is about is image and video generation AI, in this case generative AI. These kinds of AI models need to be “trained” or shown pictures and videos that they can categorize and are used as a base to generate new content. This “training” is where AI runs into some problems according to the article, as a lot of the images and data the AI is given is biased, ending up with products that promote conservative values. In a way I would argue that the idea of “training” AI is not too different from the way humans learn, like AI we take in information from our lives and that informs our opinions, biases, and even art. The problem with bias in training data is that instead of having one person that makes biased art, you give everyone with an internet connection the ability to create biased art. This almost creates a cycle of bias that will never end.

            One of the most compelling points in the article was the idea of constant bombardment and mixing of real news and fake news that we experience nowadays and how that has escalated due to AI. Since the advent of the internet we now have the entire knowledge of the human race at our fingertips, and with that all the lies and falsehoods humans have believed and told throughout history. Propaganda and lies have existed in some shape for ages, they are not new. But now with a tool like generative AI anyone can make an insane idea look real with almost no effort. Generative AI itself does not create this propaganda, it is a tool that lets everyone create propaganda. This has just escalated the idea of the “attention economy” as the article calls it, of people and companies creating more and more outrageous images and videos to draw attention. These images and videos are often accompanied by an even more outrageous message meant to drive engagement even higher. These companies can then capitalize on our attention by selling ad space.

            All in all I think that generative AI, while cool in concept, is one of the worst uses of AI we currently have. It is also a tool, one that is often created and used in a wrong way.
