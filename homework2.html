            <p class="image_text">
            I chose this image because of the leading lines. The different colored tiles, the handrails, and the light strip all leadi up to the shadowy door. I wanted to make the hallway feel more ominous, so in photoshop I darkened the shadows as most of them were by the door. I also made the entire image more blue to give it a colder, almost clinical feel.

        <div class="image_text">
            <img src="images/warmlight.jpg" width="300"/>
            <p class="image_text">
                I decided to shoot this image because I really love the symmetry that the squares create. With the bright light it creates an almost tessellated effect. I thought the original image was really good to begin with so I only made a few edits. I first cropped the image down so more of it was the light itself, and I did want to make the light a little more yellow to give a warm feel.
